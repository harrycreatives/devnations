## Lets begin our journey in Azure SQL Databases
* Databases are structured data
* Azure SQL is a general purpose relational database service in Azure that supports structures such as __JSON__, __spatial__ and __XML__.

* Azure SQL Database is the intelligent, fully-managed relational cloud database service. 
* SQL Database is a high-performance, reliable, and secure cloud database that you can use to build data-driven applications and websites in the programming language of your choice, without needing to manage infrastructure. 
* Take advantage of built-in intelligence that learns app patterns and adapts to maximize performance, reliability, and data protection.
